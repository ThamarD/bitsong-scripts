Adjusted for bitsong by Thamar

The provided script enable delegators to claim all their staking rewards and reinvest them, to receive compounded interest. In addition to this, it supports withdrawal of validator commission.

Not sure about this [Thamar] Requirement is to run a local full node as the script defaults to using the https://localhost:443 RPC endpoint.


### Installation

First download the script and make it executable:
```
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/block-finance/cosmoshub-scripts/master/cosmoshub-reinvest-rewards.sh
chmod +x cosmoshub-reinvest-rewards.sh
```

### Enjoy the show

The script has some default settings and only requires you to provide the name for the account you wish to work with.

The name must match the output of the NAME: column of `bitsongcli keys list`:  

You can now run the script:
```
./bitsong-reinvest-rewards.sh testkey1
```

and expect output such as:

```

### Customize settings (optional)
If you like, you can use your favorite text editor to change some of the default settings of the script.

```
